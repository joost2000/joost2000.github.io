# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Hi! I'm Joost Ottens, a game developer who enjoys building worlds, systems, and mechanics that players can truly get lost in. I spend most of my time working with Unreal Engine and Unity, always looking for ways to make ideas come to life. On this site you’ll find the projects I’ve been working on. If you’re curious about the technical side of things, my GitHub has the code behind them. If you’d like to reach out — whether it’s about a project, collaboration, or just to talk games — you can find my contact details here as well.
