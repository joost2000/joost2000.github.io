      While working as a contractor for Games By Hyper, I was tasked with developing a jigsaw inventory system in Unreal Engine using Blueprints. This system builds on the existing Inventory System Advanced, but adapts its functionality to support a jigsaw-style grid. 
      
      My main responsibility was to modify and extend key functions so that items could be arranged in irregular, puzzle-like shapes rather than standard grid slots. The result is a flexible inventory system that allows for more dynamic item placement and management, tailored to the needs of the project.

      For Games By Hyper, I also developed a list based inventory system in Unreal Engine using Blueprints. This system provides a straightforward way to manage items in a linear list format, making it easy for players to view and organize their inventory.

      My work involved designing and implementing the core logic for adding, removing, and sorting items within the list. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface and ensuring that the system could be easily integrated into different projects. The result is a reliable and efficient inventory solution that supports a wide range of gameplay scenarios.
