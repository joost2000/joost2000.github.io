- name: Airport Architect
  description: Airport Tycoon is a game about managing your own terminal! In this game the player needs to manage the passenger flow of the terminal to keep it from overflowing, this can be achieved by placing check-in booths, security gates and boarding gates! Just a gate or booth will not suffice of course, you will need to construct the very best part about terminals... the queue! Airport Tycoon was developed in collaboration with the aviation department of our university. Our goal was to raise awareness about the complex challenges and significant costs involved in running an airport terminal. By simulating real-world scenarios, the game helps players understand the decision-making, resource management, and operational difficulties that terminal owners face every day.
