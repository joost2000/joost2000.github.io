      Planet Generation is a project I developed during my final year at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. The main objective was to explore procedural generation and real-time deformation of planetary bodies using advanced algorithms.

      This project leverages the marching cubes algorithm to create detailed, three-dimensional planets that can be dynamically shaped and modified. By simulating geological processes and allowing for interactive terraforming, the project demonstrates how procedural techniques can be used to generate complex, realistic environments in real time.

      Overall, Planet Generation showcases my ability to apply computer graphics and algorithmic concepts to solve challenging problems in interactive media.

     My motivation for this project was to deepen my understanding of advanced techniques in game development, particularly those involving procedural content and real-time graphics. I chose to implement the marching cubes algorithm because of its complexity and its wide range of applications.

      Although the marching cubes algorithm was originally developed for medical imaging, it has proven to be highly effective for tasks such as terrain generation and 3D modeling. This versatility is what drew me to explore the technique further and apply it in a new context.

      By working on this project, I aimed to challenge myself technically and creatively, while gaining practical experience with algorithms that are valuable in both academic and industry settings.

      I began by building a basic marching cubes implementation to generate 3D meshes from scalar fields. As I refined the project, I focused on optimizing performance and enabling real-time terraforming. 

      For a deeper look at my optimization process and technical decisions, you can read my paper on the project:
